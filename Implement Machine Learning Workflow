First, I will post my formula's predictions for every game in week 6 (October 13-14, 2024). After that, I will post the NFL Elo model's predictions based on the ALC's spreads. I hypothesize that I will need to reduce my formula's reliance on scoring defense rating and increase the weighting for the opponents' coaching staff.
