Project Scoping

I'm hoping to create a formula that is more accurate than the NFL Elo model (63.9%).
I think my formula will need to achieve at least 75% accuracy in predicting outright winners in order to worthwhile.
So far, I've spent more than three hours tweaking my formula. For the time being, the ALC's over/under and spreads are way more accurate than my formula.

To start the project, my current formula is: NFL Team points scored = (ALC Projected Points) + Coaching Staff (out of 10) + weather (out of 10) - (33 - Scoring Defense Rank)/4 - (Opponent's Coaching Staff out of 10)/2

I believe the oddsmakers rely on total defense ratings (yards allowed per game), but I think points allowed per game is a better measure of a team's defense.
